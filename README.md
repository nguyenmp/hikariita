A flashcard app designed for Mark Nguyen to study Chinese and Japanese.

Why yet another flashcard app?  I tried Anki and found that the existing content on that platform to be hard to puruse.  Additionally, it only had a concept of "front" and "back".  Meaning you could only quiz on some pre-defined "front" and answer with some predefined "back".  Traditionally, it's Kanji in the front and meaning in the back.  I want something where I can quiz on any of the following and answer with the other two: (1) hirigana, (2) kanji, and (3) meaning.  Additionally, I found the Android app to be pretty janky and hard to understand.  Third, because the existing flashcard stacks were not exactly what I wanted, I needed a way of copying the content and adding what I desired, or fixing what was wrong.  Unfortunately, my only alternative was to upload my own content instead.

Given the amount of work I would need to put into creating this content, I figured adding the application layer on top to do exactly what I wanted was worth the time.
